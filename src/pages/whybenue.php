                <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
                    Benue State is often referred to as the "Food Basket of the Nation" due to its fertile soil and

                    produces a significant portion of Nigeria's food crops, including yam, maize, soybeans, and sorghum
                    and many crops. Foreign investors can tap into this agricultural potential to meet the growing
                    demand for food both within Nigeria and in the international market.
