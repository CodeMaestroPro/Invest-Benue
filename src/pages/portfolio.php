            The Benue State Government recognizes the critical role that Foreign Direct
            Investments (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPI) can play in fostering economic growth,
            job creation, and overall development in the state. To facilitate these investments,
            the state has established the Office of the Special Adviser on International Investment,
            a dedicated entity tasked with attracting and managing foreign investments.
            Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): FDI refers to the investment made by a company
            or individual from one country into a business or entity located in another country.
            It typically involves a long-term interest in, and a significant degree of control over,
            the foreign enterprise.

                    In FDI, the investor acquires a substantial ownership stake
                    (usually over 10%) in the foreign entity, giving them influence over its management and
                    decision-making.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Long-term Perspective:</span> FDI is usually associated with a long-term
                    commitment, as investors aim to
                    establish a lasting presence and generate returns over an extended period.

                    and skills to the host country, promoting economic development.

            Both FDI and FPI play important roles in the global economy. FDI contributes to economic growth,
            job creation, and technology transfer, while FPI provides liquidity to financial markets, facilitates
            capital flows, and allows investors to diversify their portfolios. Benue State Governments often have
            policies in place to attract FDI for economic development and to regulate FPI for financial stability
            and control over capital markets.
